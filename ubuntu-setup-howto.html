<h1>Step-by-step guide to installing sma-bluetooth on Ubuntu Linux</h1>

<p>This guide will lead you through the process of installing and configuring the
   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sma-bluetooth/source/clones" target="_blank">sma-bluetooth</a> tool that enables you to pull
   data from your SMA Sunnyboy inverter via bluetooth in Linux and upload it to <a href="http://pvoutput.org" target="_blank">PVOutput</a>.
   It specifically uses a version of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sma-bluetooth/source/clones" target="_blank">sma-bluetooth</a>
   tool that has been modified by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sma-bluetooth/source/clones" target="_blank">Tony Brown</a> and then myself
   (<a href="http://code.google.com/r/rcphills-sma-bluetooth-dbabstraction/" target="_blank">Rob Hills</a>), to store its data into a simple SQLite3 database.
   While this version of the smatool program is also capable of storing your Inverter logs in a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>
   database, this guide does not cover the use of MySQL.</p>
<p>The following steps require you to complete some relatively geeky tasks like downloading source code, compiling programs and creating databases.
   Nevertheless, the aim of this guide is to help the non-programmer to navigate his/her way through these tasks.  If the guide doesn't do this for you
   and you have some constructive comments to improve it, please contact me (Rob Hills) via the
   <a href="http://code.google.com/r/rcphills-sma-bluetooth-dbabstraction/" target="_blank">source code page</a>.</p>

<p>The following steps assume that:
	<ol>
		<li>You have created a <a href="http://pvoutput.org/account.jsp" target="_blank">PVOutput Account</a>;</li>
		<li>you are running Ubuntu Linux; and</li>
		<li>you have opened a Terminal window.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><h2>Open the text editor</h2>
    <p>You'll need this at various times so you may as well open it now. Type
    (or copy/paste) the following into your Terminal Window:</p>
    <code>gedit &amp;</code>
    <p class="smaller">Note, the " &amp;" bit at the end is important - it
    makes your editor run in the background without tying up your terminal. If
    you forget it, you will find you can't type anything more in the terminal
    without closing the text editor window.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Install dependencies</h2>
    <p>Dependencies are programs that need to be installed before our sma-bluetooth system can be downloaded, built and operated correctly.</p>
    <p>At the terminal prompt, type (or copy the following line and paste it
    into your terminal):</p>
    <p><code>sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libbluetooth-dev
    libcurl4-openssl-dev mercurial make</code> </p>
    <p>You will probably be prompted for a password - use your usual Ubuntu
    password (or nothing if you don't have to log in to Ubuntu). Following
    this, you will see a series of programs downloaded and installed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Make a folder for the program</h2>
    <p>This guide assumes your program will run in a folder named
    "sma-bluetooth" inside another folder named "bin" (short for "binary") in
    your home directory. To do this, type (or copy/paste) the following line
    into your Terminal Window:</p>
    <code>mkdir -p ~/bin/sma-bluetooth</code>
    <p>Now change to our newly created directory:</p>
    <code>cd ~/bin/sma-bluetooth</code> </li>
  <li><h2>Download the program source</h2>
	  <p>You will be downloading the program code for a version of the sma-bluetooth program that has been modified to store all the downloaded data in a simple
		  (SQLite3) database.  You don't need to know or understand this, but it can be useful for analysing the data etc.
		  To do this, type (copy/past) the following into your terminal window:</p>
	  <code>hg clone https://rcp.hills@code.google.com/r/rcphills-sma-bluetooth-dbabstraction/ ./</code>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Build the Program</h2>
	  <p>In the previous step, you downloaded the <em>source code</em> for the program, but the computer can't run this.  To convert it to something the computer
		 can run, you need to &quot;build&quot; the program.  To do this, type (or copy/past) the following into your Terminal Window.</p>
	  <code>make sqlite</code>
	  <p>If this command has been successful, you should see a number of &quot;gcc&quot; commands and some warnings, but <strong>no errors</strong>.  Several new
	     files will have been created including one named <em>smatool</em>.  If you now type the following in your terminal window:</p>
	  <code>./smatool -?</code>
	  <p>you should see a &quot;help&quot; screen giving concise details about how to run the program.  If you do, congratulations, you have now successfully installed
	     your &quot;sma-bluetooth&quot; program!</p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Check Bluetooth Configuration</h2>
    <p>We&apos;re now ready to configure our program, but first we need to sort out some Bluetooth details.  Start by 	     checking that the SMA Inverter is visible via Bluetooth - type the following in your terminal window
       (or copy/paste):</p>
    <code>hcitool scan</code>
    <p>Hopefully you will see something like this:</p>
    <code>Scanning ...<br /> </code>
    <code class="indented">00:80:75:19:DB:25 SMA001d SN: 2100424002 SN2100424002</code>
    <p>Depending on how many bluetooth devices are visible, you may see more
    than one line of scan results. Like the one above, you should see something
    in it that identifies it as your SMA inverter. The special code at the
    beginning (ie the <em>00:80:75:19:DB:25</em> bit above) is the "Bluetooth
    Address" of your SMA inverter and you'll need this later. Copy it (wipe it
    with your mouse, right-click and select "copy" from the menu) and paste it
    into your Text Editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h2>Create your configuration file</h2></li>
  <p>The <em>smatool</em> program reads a special file named &quot;smatool.conf&quot; for its configuration information.  You have already downloaded a template
     of this file when you <em>downloaded the program source</em> a few steps back.  This template is named &quot;smatool.conf.new&quot; and you&apos;ll now
     make a copy of that by typing (copy/paste) the following into your terminal window:</p>
  <code>cp smatool.conf.new smatool.conf</code>
  <li><h2>Customise your configuration file</h2></li>
  <p>There are several lines in your configuration file that will need to be checked and possibly changed.  To do this, open your configuration file with
     the default text editor <em>gedit</em>:</p>
  <code>gedit smatool.conf &amp;</code>
  <p class="smaller">Note 1: The very bottom of the editor (the <em>status bar</em>) shows a number of bits of information
     including the line number.  When you first open your <em>smatool.conf</em> file, near the right end of the
     status bar, it should say something like <em>Ln 1, Col 1</em>.  As you move the cursor around with either your
     keyboard arrow keys, or your mouse, the status bar should update to indicate which line (and column) your cursor
     is positioned at.</p>
  <p class="smaller">Note 2: Look through the file and notice that some lines start with a # (pound) character.  These lines are ignored by the program - they are
     known as &quot;comments&quot;.  After you have finished modifying your smatool.conf file, feel free to add your own comment lines as a reminder about changes
     you have made.  Note, the # (pound) character must be <strong>in column 1 of the line</strong>.</p>
  <p class="smaller">Note 3: If you already had your text editor open as suggested earlier, you will almost certainly find that it has opened your smatool.conf
     file in a new tab in the same text editor window.  The tabs should be near the top of your editor window, just beneath the toolbar.</p>
  <p><strong>Line 9:</strong> This specifies which Inverter you have.  The available options are listed in the comment in line 8.  If your inverter is <em>not</em>
     a 3000TL, you need to change this value.</p>
  <p><strong>Line 11:</strong> You <strong>must</strong> put your Inverter&apos;s Bluetooth Address value here.  You have already found out this value in step 6
     above and if you followed those instructions, you'll have pasted it into the other tab in your editor.  Click on its tab (it will most likely be called
     &quot;Untitled Document 1&quot;), highlight the Bluetooth Address (something like &quot;00:80:75:19:DB:25&quot;), right-click and select &quot;copy&quot; from
     the dropdown menu.  Then click back on your &quot;smatool.conf&quot; tab, add a space or three after the &quot;BTAddress&quot; word that&apos;s already
     there and paste in your Inverter&apos;s Bluetooth Address (right-click and choose &quot;paste&quot; from the dropdown menu).  It should end up looking something
     like this:</p>
  <code>BTAddress&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00:80:75:19:DB:25</code>
  <p><strong>Line 15:</strong> You <strong>must</strong> put your Inverter&apos;s User password in here.  By default, this is usually four zeroes &quot;0000&quot;,
     unless your installer has changed it.  Add one or three spaces after the word &quot;Password&quot; on this line and then put your password.  It should end
     up looking something like this:</p>
  <code>Password&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0000</code>
  <p><strong>Lines 22 and 23:</strong> While the &quot;location&quot; is not required, I have found the program works better if you include your location.
     You need to put in the latitude and longitude in whole degrees only.  If you don't know your latitude and longitude, you can find them using the
     <a href="http://www.earthtools.org/" target="_blank">Earth Tools website</a>.  These two lines should end up looking something like this:</p>
  <code>Latitude&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-32<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longitude&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;115</code>
  <p class="smaller">Note, by convention Latitude and Longitude are expressed as a pair of numbers, with Latitude usually given first.  Latitude is the number of
    degrees North or South of the equator (indicated by a &quot;N&quot; or &quot;S&quot; following the number).  Longitude is the number of degrees East or West of
    Greenwich (UK) (indicated by an &quot;E&quot; or &quot;W&quot; following the number). The &quot;smatool&quot; program doesn't use N, S, E, or W, but instead
    uses positive or negative numbers.  Hence, if your Latitude is South of the equator, it should be a negative number (like mine above).  If your longitude is
    West of Greenwich, it should be a negative number. North Latitudes and East Longitudes are positive numbers.</p>
  <p><strong>Lines 25 to 28:</strong> These lines contain the Database configuration and are necessary if you wish to keep a local store of your Inverter logs.
    Although these lines refer to &quot;MySQL&quot; database stuff, we will actually be using a SQLite3 database.</p>
  <p><strong>Line 25:</strong> MySqlHost - this is the name of the computer that will contain the database.  Almost certainly it will be the same computer as you're
     running your program on which is referred to by the nickname &quot;localhost&quot; and will look like this:</p>
  <code>MySqlHost&nbsp;&nbsp;localhost</code>
  <p><strong>Line 26:</strong> MySqlDatabase - this contains the full name of your database, including the folder that it lives in.  If you&apos;re not sure,
     simply use the following example, which will create a database named &quot;smatool.sqlite3.db&quot; in a folder named &quot;smatool&quot; in your home
     directory:</p>
  <code>MySqlDatabase&nbsp;&nbsp;~/smatool/smatool.sqlite3.db</code>
  <p><strong>Lines 27 and 28:</strong> Username and Password.  SQLite databases usually don't have usernames and passwords, however if you leave these empty,
     the program won&apos;t work.  I simply put an &quot;x&quot; for each of them, like this:</p>
  <code>MySqlUser x<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MySqlPwd x</code>
  <p><strong>Lines 30 to 32:</strong> These contain the critical PVOutput configuration details:</p>
  <p><strong>Line 30:</strong> You can simply leave this line as it is.  This is the link on the PVOutput site that the program will use to upload your data.</p>
  <p><strong>Line 31:</strong> PVOutput Key - you <strong>must</strong> enter this value.  You will find it on your
     <a href="http://pvoutput.org/account.jsp" target="_blank">PVOutput Settings page</a> in the third-last field from the bottom of the page.
     It is called the &quot;API Key&quot;.  I suggest that you copy it from your settings page and paste it into your configuration file.  After you've done this,
     it should look something like this:</p>
  <code>PVOutputKey&nbsp;&nbsp;6e4768c8e6a2b26f5c88c0d501f2c7010742ad7c</code>
  <p><strong>Line 32:</strong> PVOutput SID - you <strong>must</strong> enter this value.  You will find it on your
     <a href="http://pvoutput.org/account.jsp" target="_blank">PVOutput Settings page</a> in the last field at the bottom of the page.
     It is called the &quot;System ID&quot;.  I suggest that you copy it from your settings page and paste it into your configuration file.  After you've done this,
     it should look something like this:</p>
  <code>PVOutputSid	9068</code>
  <li><h2>Create your database</h2></li>
  <p>The sma-bluetooth program needs a database to store values that it extracts from your inverter.  It will create the database for you if you type (copy/paste) the following into your terminal window:</p>
  <code>./smatool --INSTALL</code>
  <li><h2>Test your setup</h2></li>
  <p>The sma-bluetooth program should now be ready to roll. Test it by typing (copy/paste) the following into your terminal window.  These will upload all data so far for the current day (assuming it is daylight):</p>
<code>
starttime="$(date +%Y-%m-%d) 00:00:00"<br />
endtime="$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %T')"<br />
./smatool -from "$starttime" -to "$endtime" -repost 2>&1 | logger -t smatool -p local5.info
</code>
  <p>The program will log its progress (and any errors) to a file named "smatool.log" in the /var/log directory</p>
  <li><h2>Automate your uploads</h2></li>
  <p>You can use the Linux &quot;cron&quot; program to automate your data logging.  I have mine set up to post data every half hour so as not to keep harassing the Inverter.  I have included an example cron file with this html document, but you need to edit it before you can use it. Type (copy/paste) the following into your terminal window:</p>
<code>gedit ./smatool.cron &amp;</code>
  <p>When the file opens in your editor, look in the last line only for the text &quot;your-user-name&quot; which appears twice in that line.  Now replace it with your actual Ubuntu login name.</p>
  <p>Now you can copy this file to the folder it needs to be in to do its job. Type (copy/paste) the following into your terminal window 
     (when prompted for a password, enter your usual login password):</p>
<code>
sudo cp ./smatool.cron /etc/cron.d/smatool<br />
sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.d/smatool<br />
sudo chown root:root /etc/cron.d/smatool
</code>
<p>That's it!  Now, your smatool should run every half hour (on the hour and the half-hour), pull the latest data from your inverter, store it in your
   database and then upload it to PVOutput.</p>
</ol>
